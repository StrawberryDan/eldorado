#### Tanaka Contour Lines

Tanaka contours are the same as normal ones except that they are shaded differently based on an imaginary light source. This gives an illusion of depth.

#### Monochrome Relief Shading

Shading ever pixel in the heightmap according to some imaginary light source also gives an impression of depth.
